# Instructions for Codex

1. Before starting any task, read `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root and follow it.
2. If the task touches `dashboard/`, also read `dashboard/CLAUDE.md` and follow it.
3. If rules conflict, the more local file has priority: for `dashboard/*`, `dashboard/CLAUDE.md` takes precedence.
